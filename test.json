      "description": "Naruto was the son of the fourth hokage, Minata Namikaze, and the jinchuriki of the Nine Tails, Kushina Uzumaki. The parents named their son after the hero of the first book, Jiraiya, making him Naruto's godfather. Before his birth, Hiruden Sarutobi was worried that the fuin holding the Nine-Tailed One might collapse during the birth. To prevent this, the birth was held as far away from the hidden village as possible, with Biwako Sarutobi and Taji in the midwives' womb, as well as Minata and several ninja from the STLB to support the fuin.But immediately after the birth, a mysterious person appears in the guise of the entire support staff. She takes the newborn Naruto hostage to force Minato to leave Kushina.",

      "description": "The organisation was originally founded by Yahiko during the Third World Shinobi War, along with his childhood friends, Nagato and Konan. Orphans of the Second World Shinobi War, they created Akatsuki as a way to bring peace to their home village of Amegakure, too often serving as a battleground for the Five Great Shinobi Nations. Their desire to end the war drew many Amegakure ninja to their cause, and over time word of their exploits began to spread beyond Amegakure. Akatsuki's early fame had much to do with Yahiko's leadership and his natural charisma, which kept the group united in purpose and encouraged them to persevere despite the difficulties of their goal. However, Yahiko saw himself as merely a go-between for Nagato, who would eventually become the actual source of world peace because of his Rinnegan.",
